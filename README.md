# Hello Yaar
## Project Description:

Developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, implementing MVVM architecture for state management.
Utilized Firebase Auth for user authentication, Firestore for storing user and message data, and Firebase Storage
for uploading images and videos.
Integrated Firebase FCM for sending notifications and Coil for asynchronous image loading.
Employed Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Navigation for animated transitions, and ExoPlayer for video
playback.
